Jan Sahayak is an AI-powered assistant designed to help Indian citizens discover, understand, and stay informed about government welfare schemes in a simple and accessible way.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Despite the availability of numerous government welfare schemes, many eligible citizens fail to benefit from them due to:

- Lack of awareness about existing and newly launched schemes  
- Complex eligibility criteria that are difficult to understand  
- Official documents written in technical or legal language  
- No mechanism to notify citizens when new schemes are introduced  

This information gap especially affects students, low-income groups, and people from rural or semi-urban areas.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Jan Sahayak acts as an intelligent informational assistant that bridges the gap between government welfare schemes and citizens.  
It uses Artificial Intelligence to understand user details, identify relevant schemes, and explain them in simple language.

The system also proactively informs users whenever a new government scheme matching their profile is launched, ensuring that no eligible citizen misses an opportunity.
